# Optimizing Django Rest Framework: Intro

## Intro
For these questions we’ve set up the Django project module2. Actually, it’s the same as module1 with a simple Post model, but with the addition of an author field to store the author of the Post.

With these questions you’re back to running tests in the usual way, with the manage.py test command. For example, to run tests just for question 1:
$ python manage.py test assessment.tests_1


In these questions you’ll set up caching, throttling and filtering on a Django Rest Framework viewset.

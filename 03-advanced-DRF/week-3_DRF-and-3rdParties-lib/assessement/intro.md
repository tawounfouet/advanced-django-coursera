# Django Rest Framework and Third-Party Libraries: Intro

## Intro
For these questions you’re using the Django project module3, which is a continuation of module2. The Post model now has an image field added. The caching and throttling have been removed to make testing easier.

In these questions you’ll set up pagination, filtering, JWT authentication and the VersatileImageField in your PostSerializer.

Remember you can run all the tests with manage.py test, or just a specific test with the module path, e.g. manage.py test assessment.tests_3.
